# evangeline

An API wrapper for [Eludris](https://elusite.pages.dev) written in TypeScript (works with JavaScript as well).

## Installation

```bash
npm install evangeline
```

or 

```bash
yarn add evangeline
```

## Basic Usage

```ts
import { Bot } from 'evangeline'; // ES modules
// const { Bot } = require('evangeline'); // CommonJS modules

const bot = new Bot('new bot name');

bot.connect();
```

## Notice

It is worth noting that Evangeline is currently in development, and likely does not work properly as of yet. If you would like to contribute, please feel free to do so, by making a Pull Request, or giving me some tips in the Eludris guild 💜.
